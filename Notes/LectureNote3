induction of loop

input a, b
x = a, y = b, p = 0
while(y>0){
if y is odd {p = p + x}
y = |_y/2_|
x = 2x
}

Invariant
ab = xy + p

for all i at  the beginning of ith interation of loop, we have ab = xy + p

x_i = value of x at the beginning of ith iteration of loop
y_i = value of y at the beginning of ith iteration of loop
p_i

Base case:
i = 1
x_1 = a;
y_1 = b;
p_1 = 0;
=> ab = x_1*y_1 + p_1

Hypothesis:
Assume at the beginning of mth iteration
ab = x_m * y_m + p_m+1
we need to prove that ab = x_m+1 * y_m+1 + p_m+1
Proof:
ab = x_m*y_m + P_m [by IH]
during ith iteration
Case1: y[same as y_m] is odd
p_m+1 = p_m + x_m
x_m+1 = 2*x_m
y_m = 2k + 1 [for some k]
y_m+1 = |_y_m/2_| = k
=> x_m+1 * y_m+1 + p_m+1
   = 2x_m * k + p_m + x_m
   = 2x_m * k + x_m + p_m
   = x_m(2k+1) + p_m
   = x_m * y_m + p_m
   = ab

Case2: y is even
p_m+1 - P_m
x_m+1 = 2 * x_m
y_m = 2k
y_m+1 = k
=> x_m+1 * y_m+1 + p_m+1
   = 2x_m * k + p_m
   = x_m * 2k + p_m
   = x_m * y_m + p_m
   = ab

Selection Sort
Input Array a of size n
for i = 1 to n
	i = minIndex
	Find index of smallest element among a[i]...a[n]
	let it be p
	swap(a[p],a[i])

invariant
1. Before ith iteration a[1] to a[i-1] is sorted
2. a[i-1] <= every element from a[i] to a[n]

Base Case; i = 1
a[1] to a[0] is true

Induction
Hypothesis:
Assume at the beginning of i iteration 1 & 2 hold

we need to prove that at the beginning of (i+1)th iteration
1. a[1] to a[i] is sorted
2. a[i] < every element from a[i+1] to a[n]
also hold

Proof:
during the iteration
at the beginning
let the smallest element among a[i] to a[n] be s
and it is bigger than a[i-1]

by IH, s >= a[i-1] <==> a[i-1] <= s
1. so a[1] to a[i] is sorted
2. a[i] <= every element among a[i+1] to a[n]

Interval Schedualing
|-----|  |------|
    |-----|    |-----| |-----|
        |-----|

Pick as many non-conflicting intervals as possible
input set of intervals s = empty set

pick the interval with earlist finish time that does not conflict with s
add it to s

Induction & contradiction
Say greedy picks
intervals G1 G2 Gq
contradiction
Assume there is a solution that gives >q intervals
OPT O1 O2 Oq Oq+1
