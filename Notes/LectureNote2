Array of integers 
	int target
Are there two integers [possibly same] in the Array whose sum quals target

All pairs of integers if any of them sum to target(a[0] and target[0])

use currentTimeMillis() to compute the running time
long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
long end = System.currentTimeMills();

to improve this:
we can sort the array for i=1 to length-1
left = target - a[i]
Do a binary search for the left in Array


movie picking problem:
* look at all possible subsets of movies
remove conflictinh subset
pick the largest subset

*Form a graph and find the longest path

*choose the earliest finish time and remove all conflictiog movies

proof method:
induction and proof by contradiction

induction:
*basic step:
	prove that the first one is true(holds)
*Hypothesis:
	Assume that n is true(holds) then n+1 should be true(holds)
	then prove it.
